OVERVIEW

    - This lock contains the all-new LockIT Pro Account Manager.


DETAILS

    The LockIT Pro d.01  is the first of a new series  of locks. It is
    controlled by a  MSP430 microcontroller, and is  the most advanced
    MCU-controlled lock available on the  market. The MSP430 is a very
    low-power device which allows the LockIT  Pro to run in almost any
    environment.

    The  LockIT  Pro   contains  a  Bluetooth  chip   allowing  it  to
    communiciate with the  LockIT Pro App, allowing the  LockIT Pro to
    be inaccessable from the exterior of the building.

    LockIT Pro Account Manager solves the problem of sharing passwords
    when  multiple users  must  have  access to  a  lock. The  Account
    Manager contains  a mapping of users  to PINs, each of  which is 4
    digits.  The  system supports  hundreds of users,  each configured
    with his or her own PIN,  without degrading the performance of the
    manager.

    There are no accounts set up  on the LockIT Pro Account Manager by
    default. An administrator must first initialize the lock with user
    accounts  and  their  PINs.  User  accounts  are  by  default  not
    authorized  for access,  but can  be authorized  by attaching  the
    Account  Manager  Authorizer.  This  prevents  users  from  adding
    themselves to the lock during its use.
    
    This is Hardware  Version D.  It contains  the Bluetooth connector
    built in, and one available port, to which the LockIT Pro Deadbolt
    should be connected. When authorizing PINs, the Deadbolt should be
    disconnected and the Authorizer should be attached in its place.

    This   is  Software   Revision   01.  It is a  much more  advanced
    version of other locks, but the first Version D release.
